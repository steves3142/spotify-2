## Login 

This is a lean spotify clone which connects to a local spotify device once logged in. To begin using the app, simply click on "Login with Spotify" with the Spotify app open and logged in on your device. 

Once logged into the app, you can control the music playing by stopping and playing or changing playlists. Take note of the changing background as you refresh or click from one playlist to the next. Your favorite playlists from your account will automatically be imported into the app so there's no need to worry about adding them into the app.
